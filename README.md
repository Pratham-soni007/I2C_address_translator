# I2C_address_translator
This FPGA-based I²C Address Translator enables dynamic remapping of a device’s I²C address, allowing identical-address devices to share a bus. It functions as a slave to the master and master to the device, ensuring reliable bidirectional communication with full compliance to standard 100 kHz and 400 kHz I²C timing.
